**Advantage**: BHSM provides emotional intelligence and self-awareness that baseline TinyLLaMA lacks.

### üìö Continuous Learning with Valence Progression
- **Learning Episodes**: 13 adaptive learning cycles
- **Valence Range**: 1.400 (emotional weight progression from negative to positive)
- **Learning Momentum**: 0.193 (positive momentum indicates improving performance)
- **Final Valence**: 0.983 (emotional weight of final learning state)

- **Knowledge Retention**: 97.4% average retention rate

#### **Understanding Valence in LLM Integration**
Valence represents the **emotional/motivational weight** of learning experiences and enables:
- **Adaptive Learning Rates**: Higher valence experiences drive faster learning
- **Memory Prioritization**: Positive valence experiences are more likely to be consolidated
- **Confidence Modulation**: Valence influences system confidence and response quality
- **Error Recovery**: Negative valence enables learning from mistakes without catastrophic forgetting
- **User Experience**: Valence-aware responses provide more empathetic and contextually appropriate interactions

**Advantage**: BHSM enables continuous improvement with emotional intelligence while preserving existing knowledge.
