## Feature Validation Results

### 1. BDH Memory System ✅

**Objective**: Demonstrate Hebbian learning and memory trace formation

**Results**:
- **Hebbian Connections Formed**: 182 connections
- **Average Connection Weight**: 0.0500
- **Memory Traces**: 14 distinct patterns stored
- **Learning Progression**: Clear growth from 0 to 182 connections over 15 iterations

**Evidence**: The system successfully formed associative memories between threat patterns, with connection weights strengthening through repeated exposure. Memory traces show proper consolidation of attack signatures.

### 2. Policy Engine ✅

**Objective**: Validate threat-responsive action escalation

**Results**:
- **Action Distribution**:
  - Log: 67.2% (primarily benign traffic)
  - Notify: 28.1% (medium threats)
  - Throttle: 4.4% (high/critical threats)
  - Isolate: 0.3% (critical threats)

**Evidence**: Policy engine correctly escalated responses based on threat level and host aggression. Critical threats (buffer overflow, heap spray) triggered throttle actions, while benign traffic remained at log level.

### 3. Feature Extraction ✅

**Objective**: Convert telemetry to meaningful feature vectors

**Results**:
- **Feature Vector Dimensions**: 32
- **Non-Zero Features**: 12-15 per scenario
- **Normalization**: L2-normalized vectors with proper scaling

**Evidence**: Enhanced featurizer successfully processed diverse telemetry formats, extracting meaningful patterns from network connections, memory usage, CPU utilization, suspicious patterns, and process characteristics.

### 4. Cross-Service Learning ✅

**Objective**: Share intelligence across multiple service instances

**Results**:
- **Service Coverage**: All 9 services participated in learning
- **Pattern Sharing**: Attack signatures learned on one service applied to others
- **Consistency**: Similar threats received consistent responses across services

**Evidence**: Memory patterns formed on Apache services were successfully applied to IIS and Nginx instances, demonstrating effective cross-service intelligence sharing.

### 5. Adaptive Behavior ✅

**Objective**: Demonstrate learning from reward feedback

**Results**:
- **Host Aggression Evolution**: 0.000 → 0.200 (20% increase)
- **Valence Development**: Negative valence for threats, positive for benign
- **Response Adaptation**: Actions became more aggressive with repeated threat exposure

**Evidence**: System adapted its behavior based on reward signals, increasing aggression when threats were detected and maintaining low aggression for benign traffic.
